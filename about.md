# Auto Rate

_In a world where Robtop expects users to **manually submit 2000 online level star ratings**, there is only 1 hero..._

Auto Rate! Auto rate automatically rates the stars on levels based upon a levels intended rating or the average of user ratings (or random if none of those are applicable)! This is the sister mod to Auto Like (though that one is more like auto tip in my mind. whatever). 

## <cr>**Disclaimers:**</c>
- Auto Rate does not give star ratings or send levels to mods. This is equivelent to a normal user submitting a rating on a level. 
    - If any Mods want to use this mod, this should work without sending levels to robtop. If it doesn't just DM me and i'll find a fix.
- Do be aware that making too many requests can get you temporarily IP banned from Robtop's servers. You would have to download a ton of levels for anything bad to occur though. This mod is not responsible for any IP bans that could occur.
